/*Instructions: Write a program that reads an integer value from the user representing 
a year. The purpose of the program is to determine if the year is a leap year 
(and therefore has 29 days in February) in the Gregorian calendar. Use a boolean
variable isLeapYear for this (initialize to false).*/
